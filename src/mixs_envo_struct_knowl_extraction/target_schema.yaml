          categories of meat (beef, pork, other meat) and poultry (chicken, turkey,

          plants, and other). Food groups include increasingly specific food categories;
          dairy, eggs, meat and poultry, and game are in the land animal food group,
          and the category meat and poultry is further subdivided into more specific
          categories of meat (beef, pork, other meat) and poultry (chicken, turkey,
          other poultry). Finally, foods are differentiated by differences in food
          processing (such as pasteurized fluid dairy products, unpasteurized fluid
          dairy products, pasteurized solid and semi-solid dairy products, and unpasteurized
          solid and semi-solid dairy products. An IFSAC food category chart is available

          plants, and other). Food groups include increasingly specific food categories;
          dairy, eggs, meat and poultry, and game are in the land animal food group,
          and the category meat and poultry is further subdivided into more specific
          categories of meat (beef, pork, other meat) and poultry (chicken, turkey,
          other poultry). Finally, foods are differentiated by differences in food
          processing (such as pasteurized fluid dairy products, unpasteurized fluid
          dairy products, pasteurized solid and semi-solid dairy products, and unpasteurized
          solid and semi-solid dairy products. An IFSAC food category chart is available

          foods are assigned to one of four food groups (aquatic animals, land animals,
          plants, and other). Food groups include increasingly specific food categories;
          dairy, eggs, meat and poultry, and game are in the land animal food group,
          and the category meat and poultry is further subdivided into more specific
          categories of meat (beef, pork, other meat) and poultry (chicken, turkey,
          other poultry). Finally, foods are differentiated by differences in food
          processing (such as pasteurized fluid dairy products, unpasteurized fluid
          dairy products, pasteurized solid and semi-solid dairy products, and unpasteurized
          solid and semi-solid dairy products. An IFSAC food category chart is available

          airplanes, space shuttles, rockets, atmospheric balloons and heights of
          places such as atmospheric layers and clouds. It is used to measure the
          height of an object which is above the earth's surface. In this context,
          the altitude measurement is the vertical distance between the earth's surface
          above sea level and the sampled position in the air
