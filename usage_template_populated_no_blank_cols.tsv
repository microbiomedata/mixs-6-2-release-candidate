	IFSAC_category	The IFSAC food categorization scheme has five distinct levels to which foods can be assigned, depending upon the type of food. First, foods are assigned to one of four food groups (aquatic animals, land animals, plants, and other). Food groups include increasingly specific food categories; dairy, eggs, meat and poultry, and game are in the land animal food group, and the category meat and poultry is further subdivided into more specific categories of meat (beef, pork, other meat) and poultry (chicken, turkey, other poultry). Finally, foods are differentiated by differences in food processing (such as pasteurized fluid dairy products, unpasteurized fluid dairy products, pasteurized solid and semi-solid dairy products, and unpasteurized solid and semi-solid dairy products.

SymbiontAssociated				http://example.com/GSC_MIxS		EnvironmentalPackage								
SymbiontAssociated	alt	Altitude is a term used to identify heights of objects such as airplanes, space shuttles, rockets, atmospheric balloons and heights of places such as atmospheric layers and clouds. It is used to measure the height of an object which is above the earth's surface. In this context, the altitude measurement is the vertical distance between the earth's surface above sea level and the sampled position in the air.						true						
SymbiontAssociated	chem_administration	List of chemical compounds administered to the symbiont, its host, or environment where sampling occurred, and when (e.g. antibiotics, N fertilizer, air filter); can include multiple compounds.

SymbiontAssociated	env_broad_scale	In this field, report which major environmental system your sample or specimen came from. The systems identified should have a coarse spatial grain, to provide the general environmental context of where the sampling was done (e.g. were you in the desert or a rainforest?). We recommend using subclasses of ENVO’s biome class: http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/ENVO_00000428. Format (one term): termLabel [termID], Format (multiple terms): termLabel [termID]|termLabel [termID]|termLabel [termID]. Example: Annotating a water sample from the photic zone in middle of the Atlantic Ocean, consider: oceanic epipelagic zone biome [ENVO:01000033]. Example: Annotating a sample from the Amazon rainforest consider: tropical moist broadleaf forest biome [ENVO:01000228]. If needed, request new terms on the ENVO tracker, identified here: http://www.obofoundry.org/ontology/envo.html.	forest biome [ENVO:01000174]											
SymbiontAssociated	env_local_scale	In this field, report the entity or entities which are in your sample or specimen’s local vicinity and which you believe have significant causal influences on your sample or specimen. Please use terms that are present in ENVO and which are of smaller spatial grain than your entry for env_broad_scale. Format (one term): termLabel [termID]; Format (multiple terms): termLabel [termID]|termLabel [termID]|termLabel [termID]. Example: Annotating a pooled sample taken from various vegetation layers in a forest consider: canopy [ENVO:00000047]|herb and fern layer [ENVO:01000337]|litter layer [ENVO:01000338]|understory [01000335]|shrub layer [ENVO:01000336].

SymbiontAssociated	env_medium	"Report the environmental material(s) immediately surrounding the sample or specimen at the time of sampling. We recommend using subclasses of 'environmental material' (http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/ENVO_00010483). EnvO documentation about how to use the field: https://github.com/EnvironmentOntology/envo/wiki/Using-ENVO-with-MIxS . Terms from other OBO ontologies are permissible as long as they reference mass/volume nouns (e.g. air, water, blood) and not discrete, countable entities (e.g. a tree, a leaf, a table top). If the sample collected is a symbiont and the sequenced entity is a symbiont of that sampled symbiont, this field describes the tissue or excretion of the symbiotic host organism, not the top-level host.
