    description: 'The IFSAC food categorization scheme has five distinct levels to
      which foods can be assigned, depending upon the type of food. First, foods are
      assigned to one of four food groups (aquatic animals, land animals, plants,
      and other). Food groups include increasingly specific food categories; dairy,
      eggs, meat and poultry, and game are in the land animal food group, and the
      category meat and poultry is further subdivided into more specific categories
      of meat (beef, pork, other meat) and poultry (chicken, turkey, other poultry).
      Finally, foods are differentiated by differences in food processing (such as
      pasteurized fluid dairy products, unpasteurized fluid dairy products, pasteurized
      solid and semi-solid dairy products, and unpasteurized solid and semi-solid
      dairy products. An IFSAC food category chart is available from https://www.cdc.gov/foodsafety/ifsac/projects/food-categorization-scheme.html

          whose physical, chemical and biological characteristics differ from the
          layers above and beneath. Horizon can be described both in absolute terms
          (particle size distribution for texture, for instance) and in terms relative
          to the surrounding material, i.e. ‘coarser’ or ‘sandier’ than the horizons
          above and below.

        description: Altitude is a term used to identify heights of objects such as

          height of an object which is above the earth's surface. In this context,
          the altitude measurement is the vertical distance between the earth's surface

          height of an object which is above the earth's surface. In this context,
          the altitude measurement is the vertical distance between the earth's surface
          above sea level and the sampled position in the air.
