Checklist				A class with slots assigned for the required, recommended, and optional metadata fields for a specific type sequence, such as genomes, metagenomes, or marker genes. The migs class, which models genomic sequences, is subdivided into checklists for specific taxa: bacteria, eukaryotes, organelles, plasmids and viruses.						
EnvironmentalPackage				A supplement to MIxS Checklists, in the sense of providing additional terms to describe the specific environment from which a sample was collected.						
AllSlotsTestClass			for build-time testing of all slots
